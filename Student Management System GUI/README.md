## Student Management System
### This Project is basic project which shows the use of List and Inheritance with for loop for storing and displaying multiple records without use of database in application. I have added Update and Delete operations too, so it is able be to perform CRUD operations in Python. You Can add, show, update and delete student in this project.
### I also added the GUI in this project using Tkinter, a built-in module in python.
